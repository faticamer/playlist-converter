<b>Playlistify</b> is a web-based project that seeks to seamlessly convert playlists from YouTube to Spotify. It aims to:

- Automate the process of creating playlists
- Provide simple and easy-to-use UI
- Quickly authenticate with Spotify

See Features for more information!

Important Note for Local Usage (Development)
--------------------------------------------

If you're running this application locally, the core functionality will not work, but you will still be able to view the front-end. Reason for this is the absence of **client_id** and **client_secret** that are the part of Spotify API. This data is intentionally hidden through the use of environment variables in the development environment. Therefore, you will not be able to do conversion without these two pieces of information. Since this application is relatively simple in terms of its functionality, I've decided to drop the option of users having to manually create Spotify applications through Spotify API dashboard, and instead simply request an access to these values privately. This scenario is less likely to happen for end-users, since the application will be hosted.

Features
--------

- Convert playlists from your YouTube profile to Spotify
- List tracks from converted playlist
- Live update of your libraries

Prerequisites
-------------

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (Preferably LTS)
